# Month 5, Week 2: MLOps Conceptual Exercises

## Instructions
These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the core concepts of MLOps. Write down your answers and be prepared to discuss them.

## Exercises

1.  **What is MLOps?**
    *   In your own words, define MLOps and explain why it is important for building and deploying machine learning models in the real world.
    *   How does MLOps differ from traditional DevOps? What are the unique challenges that ML models present?

2.  **CI/CD for ML:**
    *   What do CI (Continuous Integration), CD (Continuous Delivery), and CT (Continuous Training) mean in the context of MLOps?
    *   Describe a hypothetical CI/CD pipeline for a machine learning model. What are the key stages and what happens at each stage?

3.  **Model Monitoring:**
    *   Why is it not enough to simply deploy a model and assume it will continue to perform well?
    *   What is the difference between **data drift** and **concept drift**? Give an example of each.
    *   What are some key metrics you would want to monitor for a production ML model?

4.  **Model Versioning:**
    *   Why is it important to version control your machine learning models?
    *   What is a model registry? What kind of information would you expect to find in a model registry?
    *   How does model versioning relate to data versioning and code versioning?

5.  **Deployment Strategies:**
    *   Compare and contrast **batch inference** and **real-time inference**. When would you choose one over the other?
    *   What is a **canary deployment**? Why would you use this strategy for deploying a new version of a model?
    *   What are the benefits of using a **shadow deployment** (or dark launch) before fully deploying a new model?

6.  **MLOps Tooling:**
    *   Choose three tools from the MLOps ecosystem (e.g., MLflow, DVC, Kubeflow, etc.).
    *   For each tool, briefly describe its purpose and how it fits into the MLOps lifecycle.
    *   You don't need to be an expert on the tools, but you should be able to explain their main function based on their documentation or common use cases.
