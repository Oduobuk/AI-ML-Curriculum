# Month 5, Week 2: MLOps & Production ML

## Overview
This week focuses on MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and the practices involved in deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments. We will cover the entire lifecycle of a production ML system, from data pipelines to model serving and continuous improvement.

## Key Concepts
*   **MLOps Principles:** Understanding the core tenets of MLOps, including automation, continuous integration/delivery/training (CI/CD/CT), and monitoring.
*   **Data Versioning and Management:** Strategies for tracking and managing data used in ML pipelines.
*   **Model Versioning and Registry:** Managing different versions of models and storing them in a central repository.
*   **CI/CD for ML:** Adapting continuous integration and continuous delivery practices for machine learning workflows.
*   **Model Deployment Strategies:** Techniques for deploying models, including batch, real-time, and edge deployments.
*   **Model Monitoring:** Tracking model performance, data drift, concept drift, and anomalies in production.
*   **Retraining and Continuous Learning:** Strategies for automatically retraining models and adapting to changing data.
*   **Infrastructure for MLOps:** Tools and platforms for building and managing MLOps pipelines (e.g., Kubeflow, MLflow, AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform).
