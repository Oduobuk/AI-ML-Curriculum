# Month 5, Week 4: Generative Models Conceptual Exercises

## Instructions
These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the core concepts, architectures, and applications of generative models. Write down your answers and be prepared to discuss them.

## Exercises

1.  **Generative vs. Discriminative:**
    *   Explain the fundamental difference between generative and discriminative models.
    *   Give an example of a task where a discriminative model would be more suitable, and another where a generative model would be preferred. Justify your choices.

2.  **Autoencoders (AEs):**
    *   Describe the basic architecture and working principle of a standard Autoencoder.
    *   What is the primary objective of an Autoencoder's training process?
    *   List at least three practical applications of Autoencoders.

3.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
    *   How do VAEs differ from standard Autoencoders? What problem do VAEs aim to solve that AEs do not?
    *   Explain the role of the "reparameterization trick" in VAEs. Why is it necessary?
    *   What are the two main components of the VAE loss function, and what does each component encourage the model to do?

4.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
    *   Describe the adversarial training process in GANs, explaining the roles of the Generator and the Discriminator.
    *   What is the "minimax game" objective in GANs?
    *   List at least three practical applications of GANs.
    *   What are some common challenges encountered when training GANs?

5.  **Comparing Generative Models:**
    *   Compare VAEs and GANs in terms of:
        *   Their underlying approach to generation (probabilistic vs. adversarial).
        *   The quality and diversity of samples they typically produce.
        *   Their training stability.
        *   Their ability to control generated features (e.g., through latent space manipulation).

6.  **Latent Space:**
    *   What is a "latent space" in the context of generative models?
    *   Why is a well-structured and continuous latent space desirable for generative models?
    *   How do VAEs and GANs (specifically, their generators) attempt to achieve a meaningful latent space?

7.  **Ethical Considerations:**
    *   Generative models are capable of creating highly realistic synthetic content (e.g., deepfakes).
    *   Discuss some of the ethical implications and potential misuse cases of advanced generative models.
    *   What measures or considerations might be necessary to mitigate these risks?
