# Month 5, Week 1: Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This week introduces the fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL), a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. We will cover the core components of an RL system, different types of RL algorithms, and their applications.

## Key Concepts
*   **Agent and Environment:** Understanding the interaction loop between the learning agent and its environment.
*   **States, Actions, and Rewards:** Defining the elements that govern the agent's decision-making process and the feedback it receives.
*   **Policies:** Strategies that the agent uses to determine its actions.
*   **Value Functions:** Estimating the long-term desirability of states or state-action pairs.
*   **Bellman Equations:** Fundamental equations that relate the value of a state to the values of its successor states.
*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** The trade-off between trying new actions and leveraging known good actions.

## Algorithms
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Policy Iteration and Value Iteration for solving RL problems with known models.
*   **Monte Carlo Methods:** Learning from complete episodes of experience.
*   **Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning:** Learning from incomplete episodes, including Q-learning and SARSA.
