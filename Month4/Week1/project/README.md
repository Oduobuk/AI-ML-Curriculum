# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Challenge

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Project Goals
1. Build and train a CNN model to classify CIFAR-10 images
2. Implement data augmentation to improve model performance
3. Achieve at least 85% test accuracy
4. Visualize model predictions and analyze misclassifications
5. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 1.8+
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cifar10_classification
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**
   Run the data loading script to download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset:
   ```bash
   python data/load_data.py
   ```

2. **Training**
   Train the model with default parameters:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   
   You can customize training with various arguments:
   ```bash
   python train.py --model resnet --epochs 50 --batch_size 128 --data_aug
   ```

3. **Evaluation**
   Evaluate the trained model on the test set:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path models/cifar10_model.h5
   ```

4. **Prediction**
   Make predictions on new images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path models/cifar10_model.h5
   ```

## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and explore the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualize sample images from each class
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
- Implement data augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.)

### 2. Model Architecture
Implement at least two different CNN architectures:
1. A simple CNN from scratch
2. A deeper architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or your own design)

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
- Implement early stopping and model checkpointing
- Train the model with and without data augmentation
- Evaluate the model on the test set
- Visualize training curves (loss and accuracy)

### 4. Analysis and Visualization
- Plot confusion matrix
- Visualize model predictions on test images
- Identify and analyze misclassified images
- Visualize learned filters and feature maps
- Implement and visualize Grad-CAM to understand model decisions

### 5. Optimization (Bonus)
- Experiment with different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- Try different learning rate schedules
- Implement learning rate warmup
- Use mixed precision training
- Apply transfer learning with pre-trained models
