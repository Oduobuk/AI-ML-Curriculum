# Week 1: Clustering Exercises

This directory contains exercises for practicing clustering techniques. Complete these exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in the lectures.

## Exercise 1: K-Means Clustering
In this exercise, you'll implement K-Means from scratch and apply it to a sample dataset.

### Tasks:
1. Generate a synthetic dataset using `make_blobs`
2. Implement the K-Means algorithm
3. Visualize the clustering results
4. Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters

## Exercise 2: Hierarchical Clustering
This exercise focuses on hierarchical clustering and dendrogram interpretation.

### Tasks:
1. Load the provided dataset
2. Perform hierarchical clustering using different linkage methods
3. Create and interpret dendrograms
4. Compare results across different linkage criteria

## Exercise 3: DBSCAN
In this exercise, you'll work with density-based clustering.

### Tasks:
1. Generate a dataset with noise and clusters of varying density
2. Apply DBSCAN with different parameter settings
3. Analyze the impact of epsilon and min_samples on results
4. Compare DBSCAN with K-Means on the same dataset

## Weekly Project
For your weekly project, you'll analyze a real-world dataset using the clustering techniques learned this week.

### Project Requirements:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Apply at least two different clustering algorithms
3. Evaluate and compare the results
4. Create visualizations to support your findings
5. Prepare a short presentation of your analysis

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your Jupyter notebooks with all code and outputs
- Include markdown cells explaining your approach and findings
- Ensure your code is well-commented and organized
- Submit your work via GitHub by the end of the week
