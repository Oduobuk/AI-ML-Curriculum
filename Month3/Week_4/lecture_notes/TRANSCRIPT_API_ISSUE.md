I am unable to fetch transcripts for Month 3, Week 4, and potentially all future weeks, due to a "402 Payment Required" error from the `transcriptapi.com` service. This means I cannot generate lecture notes based on the video content.

Please advise on how you would like to proceed:
1.  **Provide an alternative method** for obtaining video transcripts (e.g., another API key, manual transcript files).
2.  **Instruct me to generate lecture notes based solely on the recommended reading materials** (this might result in less detailed notes for video-specific content).
3.  **Skip generating lecture notes for videos** and proceed with other curriculum components (assignments, datasets, cheatsheets, exercises) based on the topic and reading materials.

Until this issue is resolved, I cannot generate the lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4.
