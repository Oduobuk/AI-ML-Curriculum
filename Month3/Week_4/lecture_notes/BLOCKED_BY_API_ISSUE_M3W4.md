I am currently blocked from generating lecture notes for **Month 3, Week 4: Introduction to Neural Networks** due to the "402 Payment Required" error from `transcriptapi.com`. This prevents me from accessing video transcripts.

To proceed with Month 3, Week 4, please choose one of the following options:

1.  **Generate lecture notes based solely on the recommended reading materials** (this might result in less detailed notes for video-specific content).
2.  **Skip generating lecture notes for videos** and proceed with other curriculum components (assignments, datasets, cheatsheets, exercises) based on the topic and reading materials.
3.  **Provide an alternative method** for obtaining video transcripts (e.g., another API key, manual transcript files).

I am currently blocked and cannot proceed with generating lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4, until I receive your decision on how to handle this.
