I cannot continue generating lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4, or any subsequent weeks, until the issue with `transcriptapi.com` is resolved or you provide alternative instructions. The API is returning a "402 Payment Required" error, preventing me from accessing video transcripts.

Please choose one of the following options to proceed:

1.  **Generate lecture notes based solely on the recommended reading materials** (this might result in less detailed notes for video-specific content).
2.  **Skip generating lecture notes for videos** and proceed with other curriculum components (assignments, datasets, cheatsheets, exercises) based on the topic and reading materials.
3.  **Provide an alternative method** for obtaining video transcripts (e.g., another API key, manual transcript files).

I am currently blocked and cannot proceed with generating lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4, until I receive your decision on how to handle this.
