I understand you wish for me to continue. However, I am currently blocked by the "402 Payment Required" error from `transcriptapi.com`. This prevents me from generating lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4, and any subsequent weeks, based on video transcripts.

I have already generated the lecture notes for all weeks of Month 2, and for Month 3, Weeks 1, 2, and 3. I was about to generate the lecture notes for Month 3, Week 4 when the API issue occurred.

To proceed, please confirm how you would like me to handle the missing video transcript content for Month 3, Week 4, and any future weeks:

1.  **Generate lecture notes based solely on the recommended reading materials** (this might result in less detailed notes for video-specific content).
2.  **Skip generating lecture notes for videos** and proceed with other curriculum components (assignments, datasets, cheatsheets, exercises) based on the topic and reading materials.
3.  **Provide an alternative method** for obtaining video transcripts (e.g., another API key, manual transcript files).

Please let me know your preferred approach.
