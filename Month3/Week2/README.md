## 🏋️ Exercises
1. **PCA Implementation**: Implement PCA from scratch and compare with scikit-learn
2. **t-SNE vs UMAP**: Compare the performance and visualization quality of t-SNE and UMAP
3. **Feature Selection**: Apply different feature selection techniques to a dataset
4. **ML Pipeline**: Build a complete ML pipeline with dimensionality reduction

## 🏗 Project: Dimensionality Reduction for Image Data
Apply different dimensionality reduction techniques to an image dataset and analyze:
- How much can we reduce dimensions while maintaining good classification performance?
- Which technique works best for visualization?
- How do different techniques affect model training time and performance?
