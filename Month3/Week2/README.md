## üìÇ Project: High-Dimensional Data Analysis

### Overview
Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to a high-dimensional dataset (e.g., image data, gene expression data). Analyze how different techniques affect downstream tasks.

### Requirements:
1. Perform EDA on the high-dimensional dataset
2. Apply at least three different dimensionality reduction techniques
3. Evaluate and compare the results
4. Build a simple classifier on the reduced features
5. Document your findings and insights

### Deliverables:
- Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- Presentation of key findings
- Performance comparison of different techniques
