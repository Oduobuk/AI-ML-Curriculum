I have successfully completed the processing for Month 2 of the AI/ML curriculum. This includes:

*   **Creating the full directory structure** for each week (assignments, datasets, cheatsheets, exercises, lecture_notes).
*   **Attempting to fetch transcripts** for all provided YouTube links and utilizing the successfully downloaded ones.
*   **Synthesizing comprehensive lecture notes** for each week, incorporating information from the transcripts and the recommended reading materials.
*   **Generating and populating** the `assignments`, `datasets`, `cheatsheets`, and `exercises` directories for each week with relevant, topic-specific content.

All materials for Month 2, Weeks 1-4, are now prepared and organized in the `/home/david/AI_ML_Course/Month_2/` directory.

You previously asked:
"If you want, I can now:
 📄 Combine all Month 4 materials into a PDF study kit
 📊 Create a course progress tracker in Excel
 🧭 Build a Notion learning dashboard
Which one should I prepare for you?"

Please let me know which of these options you would like to proceed with, or if you have any other instructions.
