# Week 4: Support Vector Machines and Model Evaluation

This week, we'll dive into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and comprehensive model evaluation techniques. These are essential tools for building robust machine learning models and understanding their performance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand the theory behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Implement and tune SVMs for classification and regression
- Apply kernel methods for non-linear problems
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Handle class imbalance in classification tasks
- Interpret model results and make business decisions

## Prerequisites
- Week 1: Python for Machine Learning
- Week 2: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors

## Topics Covered

### 1. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Maximum margin classifier
- Support vectors and decision boundaries
- Hard margin vs. soft margin classification
- The kernel trick
- SVM for regression (SVR)

### 2. Model Evaluation Metrics
- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Regression metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Precision-Recall curves

### 3. Advanced Model Validation
- Cross-validation techniques
- Stratified k-fold cross-validation

## Exercises

1. **SVM Implementation**: Implement SVM on a classification problem and visualize the decision boundary.
2. **Kernel Methods**: Compare different kernel functions for a non-linear classification problem.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate and interpret various evaluation metrics for different models.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search to find optimal parameters for an SVM model.
5. **Class Imbalance**: Apply techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Weekly Project

For this week's project, you'll work on a real-world dataset to build and evaluate multiple classification models, including SVM, and compare their performance using various evaluation metrics. You'll also implement hyperparameter tuning and handle any class imbalance in the data.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` directory
2. Load the provided dataset from the `datasets` folder
3. Follow the exercises and document your findings
4. Complete the weekly project and submit your solution

Happy Learning!
