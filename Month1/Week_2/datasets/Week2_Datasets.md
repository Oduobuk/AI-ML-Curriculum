# Week 2: Datasets

This week's lessons focus on the fundamental building blocks of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, and control flow.

During this stage, we are learning how to write the code that will eventually be used to manipulate and analyze data.

Therefore, there are no specific datasets required for the exercises and assignments in Week 2. The goal is to practice the Python syntax and logic itself.

You can refer back to the datasets introduced in Week 1 to keep in mind the *kind* of data we will be working with in the future:

*   **Iris Dataset:** For simple classification.
*   **MNIST Dataset:** For image classification.
*   **Titanic Dataset:** For practicing with messy, real-world data.

Starting in Week 3 and beyond, as we get into more complex data structures and libraries like Pandas and NumPy, datasets will become a central part of our work.
