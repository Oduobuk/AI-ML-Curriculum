# Week 1 Assignment: Real-World AI Application

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to research a real-world application of Artificial Intelligence, analyze its impact, and identify the type of machine learning it likely uses.

## Instructions

1.  **Choose an AI Application:** Select a specific, real-world example of AI that you find interesting. This could be a product, a service, or a system used by a company.
    *   *Examples: Tesla's Autopilot, Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist, a specific feature in a video game, a medical diagnostic tool, a fraud detection system at a bank.*

2.  **Research the Application:** Use online resources (articles, company blogs, news reports) to learn about your chosen application.

3.  **Write a Short Report (300-500 words):**
    In a markdown file, write a report that covers the following points:

    *   **Introduction:** Briefly describe the application and the company or organization behind it. What problem does it solve?
    *   **How it Works:** In simple terms, explain what the AI does. What kind of data does it use? What is the output?
    *   **Type of Machine Learning:** Based on your understanding from the lecture, classify the AI as one of the following. Justify your choice.
        *   **Supervised Learning:** Is it trained on labeled data to make predictions? (e.g., predicting a movie rating).
        *   **Unsupervised Learning:** Does it find hidden patterns in unlabeled data? (e.g., grouping customers into segments).
        *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Does it learn by trial and error in an environment with rewards and penalties? (e.g., learning to play a game).
    *   **Impact and Significance:** Discuss the impact of this AI application. How has it improved a process, created a new capability, or affected its users?

## Submission

*   Save your report as a Markdown file named `My_AI_Application_Report.md`.
*   Be prepared to discuss your findings.
