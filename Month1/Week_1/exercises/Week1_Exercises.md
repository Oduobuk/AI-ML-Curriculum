### Exercise 1: Classifying AI Problems

For each of the scenarios below, identify which type of machine learning would be the most appropriate to solve the problem. Choose from:

*   **Supervised Learning**
*   **Unsupervised Learning**
*   **Reinforcement Learning**

Provide a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for your choice.

1.  **Scenario:** You have a large dataset of customer information (age, income, spending habits). You want to group customers with similar behaviors together to create marketing segments, but you don't have any pre-defined group labels.
    *   **Your Answer:**
    *   **Justification:**

2.  **Scenario:** You want to build a model that can predict the price of a house based on its features (square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). You have a historical dataset of houses with all their features and their final sale prices.
    *   **Your Answer:**
    *   **Justification:**

3.  **Scenario:** You are designing an AI for a chess game. The AI needs to learn how to play against a human opponent by making moves and learning from the outcomes (winning or losing the game).
    *   **Your Answer:**
    *   **Justification:**

4.  **Scenario:** An email service wants to automatically detect and filter out spam messages. They have a massive dataset of emails that have already been manually marked as "Spam" or "Not Spam" by users.
    *   **Your Answer:**
    *   **Justification:**

### Exercise 2: Stages of AI

Read the following descriptions of hypothetical AI systems. Classify each one into the correct stage of AI. Choose from:

*   **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**
*   **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
*   **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)**

1.  **System A:** A complex software used by a bank to analyze financial markets and execute trades. It is incredibly fast and effective at its job, but it cannot write poetry, recognize faces, or drive a car.
    *   **Your Answer:**

2.  **System B:** A hypothetical robot assistant that can not only perform its programmed duties (like cleaning a house) but can also learn entirely new and unrelated tasks, such as reading a novel and providing a thoughtful summary, or learning to cook a new recipe just by watching a video.
    *   **Your Answer:**

3.  **System C:** A hypothetical, self-aware digital consciousness that possesses an intellect far beyond any human. It can solve scientific problems that have stumped humanity for centuries in a matter of seconds and can design and create new technologies on its own.
    *   **Your Answer:**

### Exercise 3: Neural Network Components

Imagine you are building a neural network to classify images as either "Cat" or "Dog".

1.  **Input Layer:** If your images are 100x100 pixels in grayscale, how many neurons would you need in your input layer?
    *   **Your Answer:**

2.  **Output Layer:** How many neurons would you need in your output layer for this problem? What would each neuron represent?
    *   **Your Answer:**
