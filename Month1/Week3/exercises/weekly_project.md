# Weekly Project: Time Series Analysis of Stock Data

## Objective
Analyze and visualize stock price data using the techniques learned this week.

## Dataset
You'll be working with historical stock price data for a major company (e.g., Apple, Google, or Tesla). The dataset includes:
- Date
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume

## Tasks

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Load the stock price data
- Ensure the date column is the index
- Handle any missing values
- Add a new column for daily returns

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, std, min, max) for closing prices and volumes
- Plot the closing price over time
- Create a histogram of daily returns
- Calculate and visualize the 20-day and 50-day moving averages

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- Resample the data to weekly and monthly frequencies
- Compare the volatility across different time periods
- Identify and visualize any trends or seasonality

### 4. Advanced Visualization
- Create a candlestick chart using Plotly
- Add moving averages to the chart
- Include volume data in a subplot

### 5. Insights and Reporting
- Write a brief report summarizing your findings
- Include at least 3 key insights from your analysis
- Provide recommendations based on your analysis

## Deliverables
1. Jupyter notebook with your code and visualizations
2. PDF report with your findings (max 2 pages)
3. Interactive dashboard (optional bonus)
