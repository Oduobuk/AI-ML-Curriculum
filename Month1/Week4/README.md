# Week 4: Data Acquisition and Visualization

## Overview
This week focuses on acquiring data from various sources and creating effective visualizations. You'll learn how to work with SQL databases, handle different file formats, clean and preprocess data, and create informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Write SQL queries to extract and analyze data from relational databases
- Load data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) into pandas DataFrames
- Perform data cleaning tasks including handling missing values and duplicates
- Create effective visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Customize plots and create multi-panel visualizations

   - Subqueries and CTEs
   - Working with SQL in Python

2. **Data Loading and Cleaning** (`exercise2_data_loading_cleaning.py`)
   - Loading data from CSV, Excel, and JSON
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Data type conversion
   - Data validation

3. **Data Visualization** (`exercise3_data_visualization.py`)
   - Line plots and trends
   - Bar and pie charts
   - Box plots and violin plots
   - Heatmaps
   - Multi-panel visualizations

### Solutions
- Solutions to all exercises are available in the `solutions/` directory
- Try to solve the exercises on your own before looking at the solutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive work)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already)
2. Navigate to the Week4 directory
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Work
Apply what you've learned by working on a small project that involves:
1. Extracting data from a database or file
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data
3. Creating meaningful visualizations
4. Drawing insights from the data

## Getting Help
If you get stuck or have questions:
