# Month 1: Diamonds Dataset Assessment

## Dataset: Seaborn's 'diamonds' dataset

### Tasks:
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load the dataset and show basic info
   - Check for missing values
   - Display statistical summary of numerical columns

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle any missing values
   - Convert categorical variables to appropriate types
   - Create 'volume' feature (x * y * z)
   - Remove outliers in numerical columns

3. **Analysis**
   - Price distribution by cut quality
   - Average price by color and clarity
   - Relationship between carat and price
   - Most common combination of cut, color, and clarity

4. **Visualization**
   - Scatter plot: carat vs price (colored by cut)
   - Box plots: price distribution by color
   - Heatmap of correlation matrix
   - Custom visualization of your choice

5. **Advanced**
   - Pivot table: average price by cut and color
   - Identify best value diamonds (price per carat)
   - Analyze the relationship between dimensions (x,y,z) and price

### Submission:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Clean, well-documented code
- Clear visualizations with proper labels
- Brief summary of findings
