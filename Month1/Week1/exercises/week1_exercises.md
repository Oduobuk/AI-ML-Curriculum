# Week 1: Practical Exercises

## Exercise 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Part A: Python Installation
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher on your system
2. Verify the installation by running `python --version` in your terminal
3. Install the following packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
   ```

### Part B: Git Basics
1. Install Git on your system
2. Configure Git with your name and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
3. Create a new repository on GitHub
4. Clone the repository to your local machine
5. Create a new Python file called `hello_ai.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   print("Hello, AI World!")
   ```
6. Commit and push your changes to GitHub

## Exercise 2: Basic Python for AI

### Part A: Data Types and Variables
1. Create variables of different data types (integer, float, string, boolean, list, dictionary)
2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum and product
3. Create a list of your favorite AI applications and print each one using a for loop

### Part B: Functions and Control Flow
1. Write a function that checks if a number is prime
2. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the even numbers
3. Implement a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers

## Exercise 3: Introduction to AI Concepts

### Part A: AI Applications
1. Research and list 5 different applications of AI in healthcare
2. For each application, identify whether it uses:
   - Supervised learning
   - Unsupervised learning
   - Reinforcement learning
   - A combination of these

### Part B: Ethical Considerations
1. Read about a recent AI ethics case study (e.g., biased hiring algorithms, facial recognition controversies)
2. Write a 200-word summary of the case, including:
   - What happened
   - The ethical issues involved
   - Potential solutions or improvements

## Exercise 4: Version Control Practice

1. Create a new branch in your Git repository called `feature/ai-concepts`
2. Create a new file called `ai_terms.md` with definitions of 10 AI/ML terms
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
4. Push the branch to GitHub
5. Create a pull request from your new branch to the main branch
6. Review and merge your pull request

## Exercise 5: Jupyter Notebook Basics

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Create a new Python 3 notebook
4. In the first cell, import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```
5. In the next cell, create a simple line plot of the function y = xÂ² for x from -10 to 10
6. Add markdown cells to explain each step of your code
7. Save the notebook as `week1_exercises.ipynb`

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a folder named `week1_submission` in your GitHub repository
2. Add all your exercise files to this folder
3. Include a `README.md` file that lists all the exercises and a brief description of your solutions
4. Submit the link to your GitHub repository for evaluation
