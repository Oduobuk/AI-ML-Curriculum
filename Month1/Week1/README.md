# Week 1: Python Fundamentals for Data Science

## Overview
This week introduces the essential Python programming concepts and tools needed for data science. Students will learn the fundamentals of Python programming, data structures, and basic data manipulation techniques.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- Work with Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Write functions and use control flow structures
- Handle files and exceptions
- Use list comprehensions and basic functional programming concepts
